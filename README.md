# Dog Breed Prediction Web Application

This web application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python to predict the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image. The project includes both the Python code for the CNN model and the web application source code.

## Features

- **Breed Prediction**: Upload an image to predict the dog's breed.
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent user experience across devices.

## Project Structure

- **model**: Contains the Python code for the CNN model.
  - **dog_breed_prediction_model.py**: Implementation of the CNN model.
  - **trained_model_weights.h5**: Pre-trained weights for the model.
  - **Code in Google Colab the model:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QlyDJ22HHYJ0gB0IPJeLCSnFnMeK7nqo?usp=sharing
- **web_app**: Contains the web application source code.
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file for the application.
  - **style.css**: Stylesheet for styling the web interface.
  - **script.js**: JavaScript code for handling user interactions and communicating with the Python backend.
